# Face-mask-detection
Deep Learning mask detection model, extract relevant features from the images and classify them as masked or unmasked faces

Manually monitoring people entering such institutions is tedious and requires workforce. We can automate this process through deep learning techniques which will automatically detect people not wearing masks to prevent their entry.

# Prerequisites

1.Programming knowledge in Python.

2.Basic knowledge of Jupyter Notebook, Deep Learning, Keras.

We have build the deep learning classifer using the VGG19 transfer learning model. The VGG19 model is the successor of AlexNet, a variation of the VGG model named after the group named as Visual Geometry Group at Oxford which created it. It is a deep CNN consisting of 19 layers (16 convolution layers, 3 Fully connected layer, 5 MaxPool layers and 1 SoftMax layer) used to classify images.

It has been trained on ImageNet, a picture database with 14,197,122 images structured according to the WordNet hierarchy.
